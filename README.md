# MeetGreet

[MeetGreet](https://meetgreet-lc.herokuapp.com) is a clone of [Meetup](http://www.meetup.com), a popular web service where users can find and join groups, coordinate in-person events, and ultimately make new friends with people who have similar interests.

MeetGreet uses React, Redux, CSS, HTML, and Typescript for its front-end technology, and Ruby on Rails (with PostgreSQL) with Amazon S3 storage to handle the back-end.

## Features

### Groups, Events, and You 

As a MeetGreet user, you can join groups and attend scheduled events hosted by fellow users. Or, create your own group and start hosting events!

An example **group** may be Runners in NYC, or something even more specific such as Runners in NYC Over 50. Members join these groups because they share similar interests and want to participate in events or activities hosted by the group. Groups have **organizers**: members who are responsible for hosting events. Groups can also set to private, in which case organizers have to approve a user's request to join, and information is restricted to group members only. 

**Events** have a time, place, and description about the activity. On their respective pages, users can set themselves as attending and see who else is going. If the event's group is public, any MeetGreet user can choose to attend, even those not yet members of the group. 

### Find Groups and Events

All groups and events are searchable by keyword and/or location. 

### Personal Dashboard

Upon logging in, you'll be greeted with a personal feed of upcoming events hosted by groups that you are a member of. You'll be able to keep track of all your events and groups, as well as any that might need your attention if you're an organizer. 

## Future Implementations

* Comments and posts for group/event pages
* Search by day or timing (ex. afternoon, weekend, tomorrow)
* Suggested events and groups based on your personal user data
